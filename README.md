# geo-information-application-for-earthquake-data-based-prediction
A Django based project using Predictive Algorithm to forecast earthquakes based on Data fetched from postgres SQL

## Overview
This project uses **predictive learning** to forecast earthquakes using the **Django framework** and **GIS framework Leaflet.js**, in addition to basic interfacing. The data is stored and retrieved from a **Postgres database**, which is preprocessed to present the sites where earthquakes are likely to happen.

Using data from **1965-2016**, we train a model and predict potential earthquake sites in **2017**, along with expected magnitude and locations on a geo-spatial map.
